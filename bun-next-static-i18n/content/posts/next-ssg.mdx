title: Next.js Static Generation
date: 2025-10-12
excerpt: How this blog uses generateStaticParams to export routes.
---

This route is generated from a local MDX file. The
`generateStaticParams` function enumerates slugs so Next can
pre-render pages during build.

Because the project outputs `export`, the pages are written
as plain files suitable for static hosting.
